## Part I: Understanding the Context of the Data

Please record your answers on the worksheet below and upload it to Gradescope.

- [Part 1: Understanding the Context of the Data](lab-context.qmd)

To answer this worksheet, consult the printout of the original survey found [here](glimpse-class-survey.qmd).

## Part II: Computing on the Data

You can access the real data from the Stat 20 Class Survey by adding the following line of code to a code cell at the top of your Quarto document.

```{r}
#| eval: false

library(tidyverse)
class_survey <- read_csv("https://tinyurl.com/stat20-survey")
```

To complete the following questions, you will need to find the columns in the `class_survey` data frame associated with each variable mentioned.

#### Question 1  

*Do students prefer to spend time at the beach or in the mountains?*

Construct a plot that answers this question and calculate a measure of a typical observation (mean, median, or mode, as appropriate). Then use the plot and this summary to answer the original question in a sentence.

#### Question 2

*Is there an association between students' favorite season and terrain preference (beach or mountains)?*

Construct a plot that answers this question. Use this plot to answer the question in one sentence.

#### Question 3  

*How much coding experience do students have?* (numerical scale)

Construct a plot that answers this question and calculate a measure of a typical observation (mean, median, or mode, as appropriate). Then use the plot and this summary to answer the original question in a sentence.

#### Question 4  

*What is the relationship between students' optimism for cryptocurrency and their skepticism of the effect of technology on interpersonal relationships?*

Construct a plot that answers this question. Use this plot to answer the question in one sentence.

* * *

Six variables appear in the survey data frame that were derived from the original `prof_label` question: `is_artist`, `is_humanist`, `is_nat_sci`, `is_soc_sci`, `is_comp_sci` and `is_entrepreneur`. The `is_artist` variable is `TRUE` for those students who most identified as an artist and `FALSE` otherwise. The other five variables are defined similarly.

For the following four questions, please answer with a plot and a sentence or two written response given the structure in the plot.

#### Question 5

Is there an relationship between students most identifying as an entrepreneur and their optimism for cryptocurrency?

#### Question 6  

Is there an relationship between students most identifying as a humanist and their optimism for cryptocurrency?

#### Question 7

Propose your own question involving one of the `is_` variables and numerical variable of your choice. Construct a plot that addresses the question, calculate a measure of center for the two groups separately (e.g. comparing those who identify as artists with those who do not), then use them to answer your questions in one or two sentences.

#### Question 8

This last one is a full choose-your-own adventure: propose your own question involving two or three variables and answer it using a plot with a written interpretation.
