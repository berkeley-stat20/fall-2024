## Labs

Lab assignments are an opportunity to put the concepts from the notes into practice to answer questions about a real data set. Your lab report should be a pdf file generated from a fully reproducible qmd file. For a helpful R reference, see [base R](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/base-r.pdf), [data visualization (ggplot2)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-visualization.pdf), and [data wrangling (dplyr)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-transformation.pdf).

## Worksheets

Worksheets are pen-and-paper practice problems that we work on in class. The goal of the worksheets is simply practice: they help you drill the techniques needed to complete the labs.
