This initializes your environment by creating the file .env. It then runs docker compose.\nWhen your environment changes, for example if you log out and back in, or if you manually copy your working directory to another platform, run make clean or manually delete the .env file. Then run make up.\n\n\nBuild a Custom Image (WIP)\nThe container is normally built automatically by a CI process on GitHub Actions. If you need to alter the image, for example if you want to locally test a new library addition, you can do the following:\n\nCheckout the https://github.com/stat20/stat20-docker repository.\nMake any changes\nRun docker build -t somename:sometag .. If on an alternative hardware platform like Apple’s ARM (modern Apple computers), you can run docker build -t somename:sometag --platform linux/amd64 ..\nCreate a new file names docker-compose.override.yml with the following contents:\n\nversion: \"3.8\"\nservices:\n  stat20:\n    image: somename:sometag"

    "text": "Office Hours and Group Tutoring\nPlease stop by introduce yourself! Stat 20 offers two types of session to ask chat about the course in person but outside of class.\nInstructor office hours are useful for to discuss topics that come in the reading or broader questions about statistics and data science. They are also a fine place to ask questions about the assignments you’re working on. Please attend only your instructor’s office hours.\nGroup tutoring (GT) sessions are held throughout the week on the 3rd floor of Evans Hall. They’re a great place to work on your assignments with fellow students and seek the help of tutors whenever you get stuck. One thing to know: tutors will expect that you have done the reading and generally been attending class; this is not meant to replace class time.\nYou’re welcome to attend whichever GT sessions work best for your schedule."

    "text": "Course Culture\nStudents taking Stat 20 come from a wide range of backgrounds. We hope to foster an inclusive and supportive learning environment based on curiosity rather than competition. All members of the course community—the instructor, students, tutors, and readers—are expected to treat each other with courtesy and respect.\nYou will be interacting with course staff and fellow students in several different environments: in class, over the discussion forum, and in office hours. Some of these will be in person, some of them will be online, but the same expectations hold: be kind, be respectful, be professional.\nIf you are concerned about classroom environment issues created by other students or course staff, please come talk to us about it.\n\n\nMode of Instruction\nThis course is structured as a flipped class, meaning that you will first be encountering new concepts in statistics and data science outside of class. Class time is dedicated to expanding on the work you’ve done outside of class by working through questions solo, in groups, and as a class.\n\nBefore class\nIt is your responsibility to become familiar with the topics that appear in the course notes and to work through the reading questions on Gradescope by 11:59 pm on the day before class.\n\n\nDuring class on Tue/Wed and Thu/Fri\nClass time (2 hrs) will be spent on a range of activities, but the most common will be concept questions (using Poll Everywhere) and working through components of your Worksheets and Labs. Therefore, the most efficient way to complete your assignments is to be an active participant in class. Attendance is expected on these class days.\n\n\nDuring class on Monday\nMonday is shorter (1 hr) class that alternates between:\n\nWorkshops: less-structured class dedicated to finishing up work on your assignments\nQuizzes: see information on quizzes below.\n\n\n\n\nGroup tutoring\nTutors will offer group tutoring sessions several times each week. This is an opportunity to finish up any assignments that you’ve started in class or review any topics that are confusing for you. Each group tutoring session will be staffed by 2-4 tutors. You’re welcome to attend any session that works well for your schedule. Check the Office Hours page to see the group tutoring schedule.\nGroup tutoring is a great place to go to meet other students and collaborate on assignments with tutors on hand to help you get unstuck.\n\n\nInstructor Office Hours\nThe instructors will offer office hours each week across a range of times. We ask that you only visit the office hours of your instructor, but you are welcome to visit the tutoring sessions of any tutors, not just the ones who work in your section. We may adjust the office hour and group tutoring sessions schedule throughout the semester as we understand student needs and preferences. Please check the Office Hours page to see the times of the various office hour/group tutoring sessions.\nOffice hours are an opportunity to chat one-on-one with your instructor. Please come to office hours! Coming to office hours does not send a signal that you are behind or need extra help. On the contrary, coming to office hours early and often tends to co-occur with success in the course. Instructors are happy to chat about the course material, statistics in general, careers in statistics, and whatever other statistics or data science topics are on your mind!\n\n\nDon’t come to class if you’re sick!\nMaintaining your health and that of the Berkeley community is of primary importance to course staff, so if you are feeling ill or have been exposed to illness, whether it’s COVID-19 or something else, please do not come to class. All of the materials used in class will be posted to the course website. You’re encouraged to reach out to fellow students to discuss the class materials or stop by group tutoring or office hours to chat with a tutor or the instructor.\n\n\n\nMaterials\nThe primary materials for the course are the lecture notes, which will be posted to the course website in advance of class. We’ll teach you everything you need to know!\nThe following textbooks are useful supplementary texts but there is no need to purchase them:\n\nIntroduction to Modern Statistics by Çetinkaya-Rundel and Hardin (freely available online)\nStatistics, Freedman, Pisani, and Purves\nData Visualization: A Practical Introduction, Healy (freely available online)\nHands-on Programming with R, Grolemund (freely available online)\nR for Data Science, Wickham and Grolemund (freely available online)\n\n\nRStudio\nThe software that we’ll be using for our data analysis is the free and open-source language called R that we’ll be interacting with via software called RStudio. As a Berkeley student, you have your own version of RStudio waiting you for at: http://stat20.datahub.berkeley.edu. Most students taking Stat 20 have no experience programming; we’ll teach you everything you need to know!\n\n\n\nCourse communication\n\nbCourses\nWe don’t use bCourses for much. It is primarily used to disseminate announcements for the entire class, such as final exam information.\n\n\nDiscussion forum\nThe official discussion forum for the class will be hosted on Ed. Ed is a forum to ask and answer questions with your fellow students and course staff. It’s an indispensable resource for learning from your peers and seeking help from tutors and instructors.\nIf you have a question for staff, create a new post and mark it as “private” and it will go only to course staff. This is the best option to contact us if you have a personal concern. If your question does not include personal information and can be answered by other students, make sure it is public.\nIn a course this large, the instructors have a difficult time responding to individual emails, so please use the class forum or visit office hours if you wish to contact us!\n\n\nCourse website\nAll of the assignments will be posted here to the course website. This also holds the course notes, slides, and links to Gradescope, Ed, and RStudio.\n\n\n\nAssignments, Exams, and Grading\n\nTurning-in assignments\nYou will be turning in your assignments on a platform called Gradescope. This is also the platform where your assignments will be graded, so you can return there to get feedback on your work. You are welcome to file a regrade request if you notice that we made an error in applying the rubric to your work.\n\n\nLabs\nLabs are long-form assignments designed to apply the concepts from the lecture notes in the cause of doing an analysis of real data. This will involve both writing code and communicating your thoughts and findings in English. We’ll be working through some problems from the labs in class, but you may have to complete them on your own outside of class time. Some labs will be turned in individually; some will be turned in as groups.\nLabs are to be submitted as PDF files. These PDFs will be generated by rendering Quarto Documents (.qmd files) to HTML and then exporting the HTML into a PDF. Don’t worry if you’re not familiar with the Quarto Document as we will teach you about it!\nWe will be assessing most questions on labs for correctness but for others we will be giving credit based on completion.\n\n\nWorksheets\nDuring class, we will give you a second engagement with the day’s material in the form of a worksheet. These worksheets will run like traditional homework problems and drill the concepts in the reading notes rather than asking you to apply the concepts with a data set, like the lab does. These are graded credit / no credit, where full credit is given if you earnestly engage with the assignments.\n\n\nReading Questions\nReading questions serve to check your understanding and engagement while going through the lecture notes prior to class. There will be a handful of questions per lecture note. These questions be a mix of multiple choice, short answer, and coding questions. You can answer them directly on Gradescope. The reading questions will be due 11:59 pm on the day before class.\n\n\n\nQuizzes\nQuizzes reinforce the most important concepts from the lecture notes and provide you the opportunity to work through misunderstandings of concepts with peers and the instructor.\nThere is both an individual and group component to the quiz.\nThe individual component will last ~25 minutes. You are allowed one, A4, one-sided handwritten sheet of notes with your name in the upper right-hand corner. The group component will take place immediately after the individual component has been completed and will last ~15 minutes. Your final (composite) quiz grade will be the average of your group and individual quiz scores.\n\n\nExam\nThe final exam will be held in person during finals week. The time and date is Wednesday December 18th, 7 - 10 pm.\n\n\nGrading\nYour final grade in the course will be computed as follows:\n\nLabs 35%\nReading Questions: 3%\nQuizzes 25%\nWorksheets 7%\nFinal 30%\n\nThe grades will not be curved (&gt; 90% is some kind of A, etc.).\nIn order to provide flexibility around emergencies that might arise for you throughout the semester we will drop everyone’s lowest quiz grade before calculating your quiz average at the end of the semester. We will also drop your two lowest Reading Question scores; there are so many of those that it is understandable if you miss one or two.\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nAccomodations for students with disabilities\nStat 20 is a course that is designed to allow all students to succeed. If you have letters of accommodations from the Disabled Students’ Program, please share them with your instructor as soon as possible, and we will work out the necessary arrangements.\n\n\nLate Work\nIf you don’t get your Labs or Worksheets in by the deadline, don’t fret. Fill out the extension request form to request an extension of 1-3 days. We will be approving all requests for extensions that are three days or fewer past the assignment deadline. For longer extensions, such as serious illness, speak to your instructor.\n\n\n\nCollaboration policy\nYou are encouraged to collaborate with your fellow students on worksheets and labs, but the work you turn in should reflect your own understanding and all of your collaborators must be cited. The individual component of quizzes, reading questions, and exams must reflect only your work.\nResearchers don’t use one another’s research without permission; scholars and students always use proper citations in papers; professors may not circulate or publish student papers without the writer’s permission; and students may not circulate or post non-public materials (quizzes, exams, rubrics-any private class materials) from their class without the written permission of the instructor.\nThe general rule: you must not submit assignments that reflect the work of others unless they are a cited collaborator.\nThe following examples of collaboration are allowed and in fact encouraged!\n\nDiscussing how to solve a problem with a classmate.\nShowing your code to a classmate along with an error message or confusing output.\nPosting snippets of your code to the discussion forum when seeking help.\nHelping other students solve questions on the discussion with conceptual pointers or snippets of code that doesn’t whole hog give away the answer.\nGoogling the text of an error message.\nCopying small snippets of code from answers on Stack Overflow.\n\nThe following examples are not allowed:\n\nLeaving a representation of your assignment (the text, a screenshot) where students (current and future) can access it. Examples of this include websites like course hero, on a group text chain, over discord/slack, or in a file passed on to future students.\nAccessing and submitting solutions to assignments from other students distributed as above. This includes copying written answers from other students and slightly modifying the language to differentiate it.\nGoogling for complete problem solutions.\nWorking on the reading questions or individual quizzes in collaboration with other people or resources. These assignments must reflect individual work.\nSubmitting work on an quiz or final that reflects consultation with outside resources or other people. These assessments must reflect individual work.\n\nIf you have questions about the boundaries of the policy, please ask. We’re always happy to clarify.\n\nViolations of the collaboration policy\nThe integrity of our course depends on our ability to ensure that students do not violate the collaboration policy. We take this responsibility seriously and forward cases of academic misconduct to the Center for Student Conduct.\nStudents determined to have violated the academic misconduct policy by the Center for Student Conduct will receive a grade penalty in the course and a sanction from the university which is generally: (i) First violation: Non-Reportable Warning and educational intervention, (ii) Second violation: Suspension/Disciplinary Probation and educational interventions, (iii) Third violation: Dismissal.\nAnd again, if you have questions about the boundaries of the collaboration policy, please ask!\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat should I do if I’m on the waitlist?\nAttend both lecture and section (remember, we are teaching it as one two hour class), and submit all assignments on time. Visit your instructor on the first day of class so you can be added to the course Ed and Gradescope.\nAre class sessions recorded?\nNo. Class sessions feature a mix of group problem solving, activities, and discussion and don’t lend themselves to recording. The course notes are the main reference source for the course. Any materials used during the class session will be posted to the course website.\nIs attendance required?\nNo, but it is difficult to succeed in this course if you are not regularly attending class. Class sessions are designed to be an effective and efficient format to make progress on important assignments. Plus, it’s a great way to meet your fellow students and learn from one another. This class is very unique in that regard.\nIf you can’t attend due to a religious observance, athletic competition, or something similarly important, don’t worry. Just reach out to us via a private Ed post, and we can let you know what to keep tabs on during the time you’re away.\nAre time conflicts allowed?\n\nStat 20 does not allow students to enroll with time conflicts.\n\nWhat if I join the class late?\nIf you join the class within the first two weeks, read the syllabus and lecture notes, take a look at Gradescope to get a sense of any assignments that may have already passed, and visit office hours to check that you’re up to date with things. The first two weeks of material are very important so you must be able to make up assignments.\nAfter two weeks into the semester, you’ll have too much material that you’ll need to make up, so you will have to wait to a subsequent semester to take Stat 20.\n\n\n\nCampus Resources\nIf you ever need someone to talk to about anything that you’re going through, please feel to reach out to the instructors. For some topics, the tutors might be an even better resource because they are students just like you. Tutors can also tell you what being an Academic Student Employee (ASE) is like.\nWith regards to reports of sexual misconduct/violence/assault, you may speak with us as well, but know that we will need to report our discussion to the Title IX officer. This is detailed below.\n\nAs UC employees, the instructors (and tutors) are “Responsible Employees” and are therefore required to report incidents of sexual violence, sexual harassment, or other conduct prohibited by University policy to the Title IX officer. We cannot keep reports of sexual harassment or sexual violence confidential, but the Title IX officer will consider requests for confidentiality. Note that there are confidential resources available to you through UCB’s PATH to Care Center, which serves survivors of sexual violence and sexual harassment; call their 24/7 Care Line at 510-643-2005.\n\nBelow are some campus resources that may be helpful for you:\n\nBerkeley Supportal- great place to start\nDisabled Students’ Program\nUniversity Health Services\nUCB Path to Care\nStudent Learning Center\nBerkeley International Office\nOmbuds Office for Students and Postdoctoral Appointees\nGender Equity Resource Center\nCenter for Educational Justice & Community Engagement\nUHS Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)\nCampus Academic Accommodations Hub\nASUC Student Advocate’s Office\nBasic Needs Center\nASUC Mental Health Resources Guide"

    "text": "In the beginning was data, and from that data was built an understanding of the world.\nIn the beginning was understanding, and from that understanding sprung questions that sought to be answered with data.\nSo, which is it?\nThis is a philosophical question and it is up for debate. What is clearer is that in the process of engaging in data science, you will inevitably find yourself at one of these beginnings, puzzling over how to make your way to the other one.\nThe defining element of data science is the centrality of data as the means of advancing our understanding of the world. The word “data” is used in many different ways, so let’s write down a definition to get everyone on the same page.\nThis broad definition permits a staggering diversity in the forms that data can take. When you conducted a chemistry experiment in high school and recorded your measurements in a table in a lab notebook, that was data. When you registered for this class and your name showed on CalCentral, that was data. When the James Webb Space Telescope took a photo of the distant reaches of our solar system, recording levels of light pixel-by-pixel, that was data.\nSuch diversity in data is more precisely described as diversity in the types of variables that are being measured in a data set.\nIn your chemistry notebook you may have recorded the temperature and pressure of a unit of gas, two variables that are of scientific interest. In the CalCentral data set, name is the variable that was recorded (on you!) but you can imagine other variables that the registrars office might have recorded: your year at Cal, your major, etc. Each of these are called variables because the value that is measured generally varies as you move from one object to the next. While your value of the name variable might be Penelope, if we record the same variable on another student we’ll likely come up with different value.",

    "text": "A Taxonomy of Data\nWhile the range of variables that we can conceive of is innumerable, there are recurring patterns in those variables that allow us to group them into persistent types that have shared properties. Such a practice of classification results in a taxonomy, which has been applied most notably in evolutionary biology to classify all forms of life.\nWithin the realm of data, an analogous taxonomy has emerged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: the Taxonomy of Data.\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Variables\nThe principle quality of a variable is whether it is numerical or categorical.\n\n\nNumerical Variable\n\nA variable that take numbers as values and where the magnitude of the number has a quantitative meaning.\n\n\n\n\n\nCategorical Variable\n\nA variable that take categories as values. Each unique category is called a level.\n\n\n\nWhen most people think “data” they tend to think about numerical variables (like the temperature and pressure recorded in your lab notebook) but categorical variables (like the name recorded on CalCentral) are very common.\nAll numerical variables can be classified as either continuous or discrete.\n\n\nContinuous Numerical Variable\n\nA numerical variable that takes values on an interval of the real number line.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscrete Numerical Variable\n\nA numerical variable that takes values that have jumps between them.\n\n\n\nA good example of a continuous numerical variable is temperature. If we are measuring outside air temperature on Earth in Fahrenheit, it is possible that we would record values anywhere from around -125 degrees F and +135 degrees F. While we might end up rounding our measurement to the nearest integer degree, we can imagine that the phenomenon of temperature itself varies smoothly and continuously across this range.\nA good example of a discrete numerical variable is household size. When the US Census goes door-to-door every year collecting data on every household, they record the number of people living in that household. A household can have 1 person, or 2 people, or 3 people, or 4 people, and so on, but it cannot have 2.83944 people. This makes it discrete.\nWhat unites both types of numerical variables is that the magnitude of the numbers have meaning and you can perform mathematical operations on them and the result also has meaning. It is possible and meaningful to talk about the average air temperature across three locations. It is also possible and meaningful to talk about the sum total number of people across ten households.\nThe ability to perform mathematical operations drops away when we move to ordinal variables. All categorical variables can be classified as either ordinal or nominal.\n\n\nOrdinal Categorical Variable\n\nA categorical variable with levels that have a natural ordering.\n\n\n\n\n\nNominal Categorical Variable\n\nA categorical variable with levels with no ordering.\n\n\n\nYou have likely come across ordinal categorical variables if you have taken an opinion survey. Consider the question:“Do you strongly agree, agree, feel neutral about, disagree, or strongly disagree with the following statement: Dogs are better than cats?” When you record answers to this question, you’re recording measurements on a categorical variable that takes values “strongly agree”, “agree”, “neutral”, “disagree”, “strongly disagree”. Those are the levels of the categorical variable and they have a natural ordering: “strongly agree” is closer to “agree” than it is to “strongly disagree”.\nYou can contrast this with a nominal categorical variable. Consider a second question that asks (as the registrar does): “What is your name?” There are many more possible levels in this case - “Penelope”, “David”, “Shobhana”, etc. - but those levels have no natural ordering. In fact this is very appropriate example of a nominal variable because the word itself derives from the Latin nomen, or “name”.\nLet’s take a look at a real data set to see if we can identify the variables and their types.\n\n\nExample: Palmer Penguins\nDr. Kristen Gorman is a fisheries and wildlife ecologist at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks whose work brought her to Palmer Station, a scientific research station run by the National Science Foundation in Antarctica. At Palmer Station, she took part in a long-term study to build an understanding of the breeding ecology and population structure of penguins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Dr. Gorman recording measurements on penguins and Palmer Station, a research station in Antarctica.\n\n\n\nIn order to build her understanding of this community of penguins, she and fellow scientists spent time in the field recording measurements on a range of variables that capture important physical characteristics.\n\n\n\nTwo of the variables that were recorded were bill length and bill depth1. Each of these capture a dimension of the bill of a penguin recorded in millimeters These are identifiable as continuous numerical variables. They’re numerical because the values have quantitative meaning and they’re continuous because bill sizes don’t come in fixed, standard increments. They vary continuously.\nAnother variable that was recorded was the species of the penguin, either “Adelie”, “Gentoo”, or “Chinstrap”. Because these values are categories, this is a categorical variable. More specifically, it’s a nominal categorical because there is no obvious natural ordering between these three species.\n\n\n\nThese are just three of many variables that recorded in the penguins data set and published along their scientific findings in the paper, Ecological sexual dimorphism and environmental variability within a community of Antarctic penguins (genus Pygoscelis)2. We will return throughout this course to this data set and this study. It is a prime example of how careful data collection and careful scientific reasoning can expand our understanding of a corner of our world about which we know very little.\n\n\nWhy Types Matter\nThe Taxonomy of Data is a useful tool of statistics and data science because it helps guide the manner in which data is recorded, visualized, and analyzed. Many confusing plots have been made by not thinking carefully about whether a categorical variable is ordinal or not or by mistaking a continuous numerical variable for a categorical variable. You will get plenty of practice using this taxonomy to guide your data visualization in the next unit.\nLike many tools built by scientists, though, this taxonomy isn’t perfect. There are many variables that don’t quite seem to fit into the taxonomy or that you can argue should fit into multiple types. That’s usually a sign that something interesting is afoot and is all the more reason to think carefully about the nature of the variables and the values it might take before diving into your analysis.",

    "text": "A Structure for Data: The Data Frame\nWhen we seek to grow our understanding of a phenomenon, sometimes we select a single variable that we go out and collect data on. More often, we’re dealing with more complex phenomenon that are characterized by a few, or a few dozen, or hundreds (or even millions!) of variables. CalCentral has far more than just your name on file. To capture all of the complexity of class registration at Cal, it is necessary to record dozens of variables.\nTo keep all of this data organized, we need a structure. While there are several different ways to structure a given data set, the format that has become most central to data science is the data frame.\n\n\nData Frame\n\nAn array that associates the observations (downs the rows) with the variables measured on each observation (across the columns). Each cell stores a value observed for a variable on an observation.\n\n\n\nWhile this definition might seem opaque, you are already familiar with a data frame. You are you just more accustomed to seeing it laid out this like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nbill_length_mm\nbill_depth_mm\nspecies\n\n\n\n\n43.5\n18.1\nChinstrap\n\n\n48.1\n15.1\nGentoo\n\n\n49.0\n19.5\nChinstrap\n\n\n45.4\n18.7\nChinstrap\n\n\n34.6\n21.1\nAdelie\n\n\n49.8\n17.3\nChinstrap\n\n\n40.9\n18.9\nAdelie\n\n\n45.3\n13.7\nGentoo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might be accustomed to calling this a “spreadsheet” or a “table”, but the organizational norm of putting the variables down the columns and the observations across the rows make this a more specific structure.\nOne of the first questions that you should address when you first come across a data frame is to determine what the unit of observation is.\n\n\nUnit of Observation\n\nThe class of object on which the variables are observed.\n\n\n\nIn the case of data frame above, the unit of observation is a single penguin near Palmer Station. The first row captures the measurements on the first penguin, the second row captures the measurements of the second penguin, and so on. If I log into CalCentral to see the data frame that records information on the students enrolled in this class, the unit of observation is a single student enrolled in this class.\n\nNot a Data Frame\nBefore you leave thinking that “data frame” = “spreadsheet”, consider this data set:\n\n\n\n\n\nFor it to be a data frame, we would have to read across the columns and see the names of the variables. You can imagine recording whether or not an alien is green or blue, but those variables would take the values “yes” and “no”, not the counts that we see here. Furthermore, total is not a variable that we’ve recorded a single unit; this column captures aggregate properties of the whole data set.\nWhile this structure might well be called a “table” or possibly a “spreadsheet”, it doesn’t meet our definition for a data frame.",

A first step is to identify the characteristics of the variables that are being measured and determine their type within the Taxonomy of Data. A second step is to organize them into a data frame to clearly associate the value that is measured for a variable with a particular observational unit.\nWith these ideas in hand, we learned how to bring data onto our computer, so that in our next class, we can begin the process of identifying its structure and communicating that structure numerically and visually.\nContinue on to the tutorial portion of the notes",

We also learned about a function called data.frame(), which allowed us to bring vectors together as part of a new structure called a data frame, with each of the vectors used as columns.\nWhile the base functionality provided by R is powerful, developers often seek to find more efficient ways to complete tasks. In doing so, they push the power of R forward. R has a vast ecosystem of libraries that add new functions. Any installed library can be loaded with the library() function. Here, we will load the tidyverse library, one of the core external libraries that we will be using this semester.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nTo use these functions within this library (or any other library), you will need to run the above line of code each time you start an RStudio session!\nThe tidyverse library has many different packages which contain smaller pieces of functionality. Today, our focus is to summarize categorical data, and one avenue we have explored already is a visual summary; a bar chart. Let’s explore how the plots shown earlier in this set of notes were made. We will use ggplot2, tidyverse’s resident visualization package.\nFirst, we should load the penguins data into our environment. The penguins data is actually located in a special library made just for this course called stat20data. This library hosts the datasets which will be the subjects of your labs. Therefore, we need to load this library first.\n\nlibrary(stat20data)\n\nThen, we can load in the penguins data by using the aptly named data function.\n\ndata(penguins)\n\nOnce you do this, you will see the penguins dataset, in all of its glory, appear in the environment pane at the top right of your RStudio session (you may need to click in the area once or twice).\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can click the blue dropdown arrow to see each variable in the dataset, or for a more traditional view, you can click the white spreadsheet icon to the right:\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we’re ready to write some ggplot2 code and make our first visualization of the year!

    "text": "A first visualization with ggplot2\nThe main function within the ggplot2 package is, well, ggplot().\n\nggplot(data = penguins)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ggplot() function takes as its first argument a data frame (the data argument). By itself, there’s not much to look at; it just creates a blank canvas.\nLet’s now indicate how we want to map our variables to each area of the plot. For now, let’s just focus on the species of penguin; we’ll handle the island later.\nWe had species of penguin on the horizontal (x) axis. This piece of information (which is known as an aesthetic attribute of the plot), goes into a second argument called mapping and within a function called aes().\n\nggplot(data = penguins, \n       mapping = aes(x = species))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we’re getting somewhere. We can see the x axis has been set up with labels for the species of penguins.\nAll that is left is to actually put the observations on the plot. We do this by declaring what geometry we want and adding this information to our existing code. We can add this information via a new layer, which can be added on by using the + syntax and taking a newline.\n\nggplot(data = penguins, \n       mapping = aes(x = species)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe layer we added was a geometry layer corresponding to the bar chart, called geom_bar().\nNote that the bars are not colored like before, but are just gray. This is because we are missing the island variable! Island was represented by coloring in (filling) the bars for us according to the conditional proportions of penguins within a specific species belonging to a specific island. We can include this by adding to our aes() function in the original layer.\n\nggplot(data = penguins, \n       mapping = aes(x = species, \n                     fill = island)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost there! Note that what we have right now is just a stacked bar chart. There’s one more fix that we need to apply. Note that geom_bar() can be thought of as a function as well. One of its arguments, position, will help us solve this issue1. position defaults to a stacked bar chart, but we can fix this by supplying it with \"fill\"!\n\nggplot(data = penguins, \n       mapping = aes(x = species, \n                     fill = island)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA side-by-side (dodged) bar chart can be produced by replacing \"fill\" with \"dodge\". To recover the original, stacked bar chart, use \"stack\"!\nThere we have it!",

    "text": "In spring of 2022, the New York Times ran the following story1.\n“Consumer Prices” refers to the Consumer Price Index2, a weighted average of the prices of thousands of everyday consumer goods: sports equipment, soft drinks, sneakers, internet service, etc. An increase in that index is thought to correspond to rising inflation.\nLook carefully at the line plot. Which of the following four claims does it support?\nIn truth, this plot could be consistent with all these claims. They are, in turn, a summary, a prediction, a generalization, and a causal claim. This newspaper headline falls squarely in the first category, a summary, which seeks only to describe the data set that is on hand.\nAlthough 8.3% seems like a simple enough number, it is actually summarizing a vast data set of thousands of prices. The process of describing a data set invariably involves summarizing it, either with numerical summaries like 8.3% or with graphical summaries like the line plot show above.\nIn this unit, we will learn to critique and construct descriptive claims made with data. Although they sound elementary, descriptive claims are the most common form of claim made using data. They have the power to move, if not mountains, at least markets.",

Part III features extensions of the ideas in Part I and Part II, often to a new data set.\nYour work should feature writing that is clear and in full sentences.

You also have a broad framework to explain how these graphics are composed: the Grammar of Graphics. But to what purpose? Why plot data? For whom?\nEvery time you build a plot, you do so with one of two audiences in mind.\nThe process of building understanding from a data set is one that should be driven by curiosity, skepticism, and thoughtfulness. As a data scientist, you’ll find yourself in conversation with your data: asking questions of it, probing it for structure, and seeing how it responds. This thoughtful conversation is called exploratory data analysis (or EDA).\nDuring EDA, the aim is to uncover the shape and structure of your data and to uncover unexpected features. It’s an informal iterative process where you are your own audience. In this setting, you should construct graphics that work best for you.\nAt some point, you’ll find yourself confident in the claim that can be supported by your data and the focus changes to communicating that claim as effectively as possible with a graphic. Here, your audience shifts from yourself to someone else: other scientists, customers, co-workers in a different part of your company, or casual readers. You must consider the context in which they’ll be viewing your graphic: what they know, what they expect, what they want.\nIn these notes we discuss six ways to hone the message of your data visualization.

It might feel a bit drab to have a large mass of points all in black, the same color as the labels and surrounding text. Let’s make the points blue instead to make them stand out a bit more.\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,\n                     y = bill_depth_mm,\n                     color = \"blue\")) +\n    geom_point()\n\n\n\nClick here when you’re ready to see the result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is . . . unexpected. Why did it color the points red? Is this a bug?\nWhat we’ve stumbled into is a subtle but essential distinction in the grammar of graphics: mapping vs setting. When you put an aesthetic attribute (x, color, size, etc.) into the aes() function, you’re mapping that attribute in the plot to whatever data lives in the corresponding column in the data frame. Mapping was this process:\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s not what we set out to do here. We just wanted to tweak the look of our aesthetic attributes in a way that doesn’t have anything to do with the data in our data frame. This process is called setting the attribute.\nTo set the color to blue3, we need to make just a small change to the syntax. Let’s move the color = \"blue\" argument outside of the aes() function and into the geom_() function.\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,\n                     y = bill_depth_mm)) +\n    geom_point(color = \"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAh, that looks much better!\nColor isn’t the only aesthetic attribute that you can set. Let’s increase slightly the size of our points by setting the size to three times the size of the default.\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,\n                     y = bill_depth_mm)) +\n    geom_point(color = \"blue\", size = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s not clear that that improves the readability of the plot - there is more overlap between the points now - but the setting worked. How would it have looked if instead we had mapped the size? When you map, you need a map to a column in your data frame, so let’s map size to species.\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,\n                     y = bill_depth_mm,\n                     size = species)) +\n    geom_point(color = \"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve made a mess of our plot now, but it is clear what happened. R looked inside the species column, found a categorical variable with three levels and selected a distinct size for each of those levels.\nThis is another area in which the grammar of graphic guides clear thinking when constructing a graphic. The aesthetic attributes of a plot can be determined either by variability found in a data set or by fixed values that we set. The former is present in all data visualization but it’s the latter that comes into play when fine-tuning your plot for an audience."

    "text": "2. Adding Labels for Clarity\nYou may have noticed that ggplot2 pulls the labels for the x-axis, the y-axis, and the legend directly from the names of the variables in the data frame. This results in labels like bill_length_mm, which is no problem when you’re making plots for yourself - you know what this variable means. But will an outside audience?\nYou can change the labels of your plot by adding a labs() layer.\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,\n                     y = bill_depth_mm)) +\n    geom_point(color = \"blue\") +\n    labs(x = \"Bill Length (mm)\",\n         y = \"Bill Depth (mm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAxis and legend labels should be concise and often include the units of measurement. If you find them getting too wordy, know that you can clarify or expand on what is being plotted either in a figure caption or in the accompanying text.\nSpeaking of captions, those a can be added too, as well as a title.\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,\n                     y = bill_depth_mm)) +\n    geom_point(color = \"blue\") +\n    labs(x = \"Bill Length (mm)\",\n         y = \"Bill Depth (mm)\",\n         title = \"Penguins show little association between bill length\\n and bill depth\",\n         caption = \"Source: Data collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman at Palmer Station, Antarctica\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe title of a plot is valuable real estate for communicating the primary story of your plot. It should highlight the most important structure in the data. In the plot above, there appears to be little correspondence between bill length and bill depth. Of course, that changes when we map species to color. Let’s make that plot and title it accordingly.\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,\n                     y = bill_depth_mm,\n                     color = species)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    labs(x = \"Bill Length (mm)\",\n         y = \"Bill Depth (mm)\",\n         title = \"Bill length and bill depth positively correlated and\\n strongly dependent on species\",\n         caption = \"Source: Data collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman at Palmer Station, Antarctica\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe practice of using the plot title to convey the main message of the plot is used to powerful effect by the visualization experts at the British publication, The Financial Times4. They have developed a wealth of visualizations to help readers understand what is happening with public health throughout the pandemic. The sobering graphic below uses the title to guide the viewer to the most important visual structure in the plot: the yawning vertical gap between dosage rates between high and low income countries."

Now take a second look. What exactly is being plotted here?\nThe labels along the axes are a hint to what you’re looking at here. These are, in fact, four plots from the exact same data: Arbuthnot christening records, with the proportion of girls christened on the x-axis. What differs is the limits of the x- and y-axes.\nMost software will automatically set the limits of your plot based on the range of the data. In the Arbuthnot data, the years range from 1629 to 1710 and the proportion of girls christened ranges from .463 to .497. The leads to the default graphic found in the lower left panel. Each of the other three plots have modified the limits of the x- or y-axis to capture different parts the data scaled in different ways. In ggplot2 this is done by adding an xlim() or ylim() layer.\nThis is the power of scaling. From one data set, you can convey four different (and incompatible!) messages by changing the scale. So which one is correct? It depends on the context and the question that drove the collection of the data. John Arbuthnot sought to understand the whether the chance of being born a girl is 1/2. That question is answered most clearly by the following plot (with the title driving home that main message).\n\nggplot(arbuthnot, aes(x = year,\n                      y = p_girls)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    ylim(0, 1) +\n    labs(title = \"Proportion girls christened slightly but persistently\\n below 50%\",\n         x = \"Year\",\n         y = \"Proportion\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe importance of scale extends beyond scatter and line plots. Barcharts are often the subject of careful scaling to convey a particular message. What do you think the goal was of the creator of the plot titled “Should Britain Leave EU?”5"

    "text": "4. Overplotting\nIntroductory statistics students filled out a survey that asked them their opinion on several topics including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result was a data frame with 707 rows (one for every respondent) and 2 columns of discrete numerical data. A natural way to visualize this data is by creating a scatter plot.\n\nggplot(class_survey, aes(x = tech,\n                         y = crypto)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    labs(x = \"Technology is destructive to relationships\",\n         y = \"cryptocurrency will play a\\n dominant role in finance\",\n         title = \"No association between opinions on technology and \\n cryptocurrency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe eye is immediately drawn to the eerie geometric regularity of this data. Isn’t real data messier than this? What’s going on?\nA hint is in the sample size. The number of observations in the data set was over 600 and yet the number of points shown here is just a bit under 100. Where did those other observations go?\nIt turns out they are in this plot, they’re just piled on on top of the other. Since there are only 10 possible values for each question, many students ended up selecting the same values for both, leading their points to be drawn on top of one another.\nThis phenomenon is called overplotting and it is very common in large data sets. There are several strategies for dealing with it, but here we cover two of them.\nOne approach to fixing the problem of points piled on top of one another is to unpile them by adding just a little bit of random noise to their x- and y-coordinate. This technique is called jittering and can be done in ggplot2 by replacing geom_point() with geom_jitter().\n\nset.seed(20)\nggplot(class_survey, aes(x = tech,\n                         y = crypto)) +\n    geom_jitter() +\n    labs(x = \"Technology is destructive to relationships\",\n         y = \"cryptocurrency will play a\\n dominant role in finance\",\n         title = \"No association between opinions on technology and \\n cryptocurrency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAhh . . . there are those previously hidden students. Interestingly, the title on the first plot still holds true: even when we’re looking at all of the students, there doesn’t appear to be much of a pattern. There is certainly not the case in all overplotted data sets! Often overplotting will obscure a pattern that jumps out after the overplotting has been attended to.\nThe second technique is to make the points transparent by changing an aestheric attribute called the alpha value. Let’s combine tranparency with jittering to understand the effect.\n\nset.seed(20)\nggplot(class_survey, aes(x = tech,\n                         y = crypto)) +\n    geom_jitter(alpha = .3) +\n    labs(x = \"Technology is destructive to relationships\",\n         y = \"cryptocurrency will play a\\n dominant role in finance\",\n         title = \"No association between opinions on technology and \\n cryptocurrency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlpha is a number between 0 and 1, where 1 is fully opaque and 0 is fully see-through. Here, alpha = .3, which changes all observations from black to gray. Where the points overlap, their alpha values add to create a dark blob.\nThere’s still no sign of a strong association between these variables, but at least, by taking overplotting into consideration, we’ve made that determination after incorporating all of the data."

The ggplot2 library has several themes to choose from and yet more live in other packages like ggthemes. To use a theme, all you need to do is add a layer called theme_NAME (e.g. for the black and white theme, use theme_bw).\nThemeing your plots is an easy way to change the look of your plot. Tinker with a few different themes and considering adding them to your labs6. But, as with all design decisions around graphics, be sure to think about your audience. You might find the Excel aesthetics ugly and dated, but will your audience? If you’re presenting your plot to a community that works with Excel plots day in and day out, that’s probably a sound choice. If you are preparing a plot for submission to a scientific journal, a more minimalist theme is more appropriate."

Extensions to the R language have been authored by professional programmers1, people working in industry and government2, professors3, and students like you4.\nYou’ll be writing and running code through an app called RStudio. Beyond writing R code, RStudio allows you to manage your files and author polished documents that weave together code and text. RStudio can be run through a browser and we have set up an account for you that you can access by sending a browser tab to https://stat20.datahub.berkeley.edu/ or clicking the  link in the upper right corner of the course website.\nWhen you log into RStudio, the place where you can type and run R code is called the console and it’s located right here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The R console in RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode along\n\n\n\nAs you read through these notes, keep RStudio open in another window to code along at the console.",

This helps you keep track of things when the output spans many lines.\nAlthough it is easiest to read code when the numbers are separated from the operator by a single space, it’s not necessary.

First, while all letters are fair game, special characters like +, -, /, !, $, are off-limits. Second, names can contain numbers, but not as the first character. That means names like answer, a, a12, my_pony, and FOO will all work. 12a and my_pony! will not.\nBut just because I’ve told you that those names won’t work doesn’t mean you shouldn’t give it a try…\n\nmy_pony! &lt;- 2 ^ (3 + 1)\n\nError: &lt;text&gt;:1:8: unexpected '!'\n1: my_pony!\n           ^\n\n\nThis is an example of an error message and, though they can be alarming, they’re also helpful in coaching you how to correct your code.

You can identify a string because it is wrapped in quotation marks and gets highlighted a different color in RStudio.\nVectors are often called atomic vectors because, like atoms, they are the simplest building blocks in the R language.

    "text": "The Taxonomy of Data in R\nIn the last lecture notes, we introduced the Taxonomy of Data as a broad system to classify the different types of variables on which we can collect data. If you recall, a variable is a characteristic of an object that you can measure and record. When Dr. Gorman walked up to her first penguin (the unit of observation) and measured its bill length, she collected a single observation of the variable bill_length_mm. You could record that in R using,\n\nbill_length_mm &lt;- 50.7\n\nShe continued on to measure the next penguin, then the next, then the next… Instead of recording these as separate objects, it is more efficient to store them as a vector.\n\nbill_length_mm &lt;- c(50.7, 48.5, 52.8, 44.5, 42.0, 46.9, 50.2, 37.9)\n\nThis example shows that\n\nA vector in R is a natural way to store observations on a variable.\n\nso in the same way that we have asked, “what is the type of that variable?” we can now ask “what is the class of that variable in R?”.\n\nClass (R)\n\nA collection of objects, often vectors, that share similar attributes and behaviors.\n\n\nWhile there are many classes in R, you can get a long way only knowing three. The first is represented by our vector my_fav_numbers. Let’s check it’s class using the class() function.\n\nclass(my_fav_numbers)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\nHere we learn that my_fav_numbers is a numeric vector. Numeric vectors, as the name suggests, are composed only of numbers and can include measurements from both discrete and continuous numerical variables.\nWhat about my_fav_colors?\n\nclass(my_fav_colors)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nR stores that as a character vector. This is a very flexible class that can be used to store text as data. But what if there are only a few fixed values that a variable can take? In that case, you can do better than a character vector by usinggit a factor. Factor is a very useful class in R because it encodes the notion of levels discussed in the last notes.\nTo illustrate the difference, let’s make a character vector but then enrich it by turning it into a factor using factor().\n\nchar_vec &lt;- c(\"cat\", \"cat\", \"dog\")\nfac &lt;- factor(char_vec)\nchar_vec\n\n[1] \"cat\" \"cat\" \"dog\"\n\nfac\n\n[1] cat cat dog\nLevels: cat dog\n\n\nThe original character vector stores the same three strings that we used as input. The factor adds some additional information: the possible values that this vector can take.\nThis is particularly useful when you want to let R know that these levels have a natural ordering. If you have strong opinions about the relative merit of dogs over cats, you could specify that using:\n\nordered_fac &lt;- factor(char_vec, levels = c(\"dog\", \"cat\"))\nordered_fac\n\n[1] cat cat dog\nLevels: dog cat\n\n\n\n\nThis example also demonstrates that you can create a (character) vector inside a function.\nWhile this doesn’t change the way the levels are ordered in the vector itself, it will effect the way they behave when we use them to create plots, as we’ll do in the next set of notes.\nThese three vector classes do a good job of putting into flesh and bone (or at least silicon) the abstract types captured in the Taxonomy of Data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The Taxonomy of Data with equivalent classes in R.",

    "text": "Data Frames in R\nWhile vectors in R do a great job of capturing the notion of a variable, we will need more than that if we’re going to represent something like a data frame. Conveniently enough, R has a structure well-suited to this task called…(drumroll…)\n\nDataframe (R)\n\nA two dimensional data structure used to store vectors of the same length.

Since R stores variables as vectors, we’ll need to create three vectors.\n\nbill_length_mm &lt;- c(50.7, 48.5, 52.8, 44.5, 42.0, 46.9, 50.2, 37.9)\nbill_depth_mm &lt;- c(19.7, 15.0, 20.0, 15.7, 20.2, 16.6, 18.7, 18.6)\nspecies &lt;- factor(c(\"Chinstrap\", \"Gentoo\", \"Chinstrap\", \"Gentoo\", \"Adelie\", \n             \"Chinstrap\", \"Chinstrap\", \"Adelie\"))\n\nWhile bill_length_mm and bill_depth_mm are both being stored as numeric vectors, species was first collected into a character vector, then passed directly to the factor() function. This is an example of nesting one function inside of another and it combined two lines of code into one.\nWith the three vectors stored in the Environment, all you need to do is staple them together with data.frame().\n\npenguins_df &lt;- data.frame(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, species)\npenguins_df\n\n  bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm   species\n1           50.7          19.7 Chinstrap\n2           48.5          15.0    Gentoo\n3           52.8          20.0 Chinstrap\n4           44.5          15.7    Gentoo\n5           42.0          20.2    Adelie\n6           46.9          16.6 Chinstrap\n7           50.2          18.7 Chinstrap\n8           37.9          18.6    Adelie",

Your directory should look like this:\nintro-to-probability\n├── notes.qmd\n├── ps.qmd\nAdd the following to the front-matter of ps.qmd.\n---\ntitle: Simulation\nformat:\n  html:\n    code-tools: \n      source: true\n      toggle: false\nsidebar: false\n---\nThe title should have the name of topic, usually the same as the title of the notes. This name will be used in creating the PS name in the listing. The remaining yaml options will provide a link at the top right of the problem set webpage that, when clicked, will produce a pop-up of the source of the qmd file. Students can copy and paste this into a blank qmd file in RStudio (and can remove the extra yaml options).\n\nIf you have multiple problem set files on a single day, you can differentiate them by adding a single letter or digit following ps and hyphen. ps.qmd, ps-2.qmd, and ps-b.qmd should all work. See the source for the assignment page for the rule that determines which files show up in the listing."
