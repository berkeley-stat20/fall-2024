    "text": "At this point in the course, you have a bevy of different types of statistical graphics under your belt: scatterplots, histograms, dot plots, violin plots, box plots, density curves, and bar plots of several kinds. You also have a broad framework to explain how these graphics are composed: the Grammar of Graphics. But to what purpose? Why plot data? For whom?\nEvery time you build a plot, you do so with one of two audiences in mind.\nThe process of building understanding from a data set is one that should be driven by curiosity, skepticism, and thoughtfulness. As a data scientist, you’ll find yourself in conversation with your data: asking questions of it, probing it for structure, and seeing how it responds. This thoughtful conversation is called exploratory data analysis (or EDA).\nDuring EDA, the aim is to uncover the shape and structure of your data and to uncover unexpected features. It’s an informal iterative process where you are your own audience. In this setting, you should construct graphics that work best for you.\nAt some point, you’ll find yourself confident in the claim that can be supported by your data and the focus changes to communicating that claim as effectively as possible with a graphic. Here, your audience shifts from yourself to someone else: other scientists, customers, co-workers in a different part of your company, or casual readers. You must consider the context in which they’ll be viewing your graphic: what they know, what they expect, what they want.\nIn these notes we discuss six ways to hone the message of your data visualization. They are:\nWe will use two running examples throughout these notes: a line plot of the number of christenings in 17th century London1 and a scatter plot showing the bill sizes of penguins near Palmer Station, Antarctica2.\nCodelibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(stat20data)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\narbuthnot &lt;- mutate(arbuthnot, total = boys + girls)\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(arbuthnot, aes(x = year,\n                            y = total)) +\n    geom_line()\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,\n                           y = bill_depth_mm)) +\n    geom_point()\n\np1 + p2"

    "text": "1. Mapping vs Setting\nOnce you have your first draft of a plot complete and you’re thinking about how to fine tune it for your audience, your eye will turn to the aesthetic attributes. Is that color right? What about the size of the points?\nConsider the first draft of the penguins plot above. It might feel a bit drab to have a large mass of points all in black, the same color as the labels and surrounding text. Let’s make the points blue instead to make them stand out a bit more.\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,\n                     y = bill_depth_mm,\n                     color = \"blue\")) +\n    geom_point()\n\n\nClick here when you’re ready to see the result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is . . . unexpected. Why did it color the points red? Is this a bug?\nWhat we’ve stumbled into is a subtle but essential distinction in the grammar of graphics: mapping vs setting. When you put an aesthetic attribute (x, color, size, etc.) into the aes() function, you’re mapping that attribute in the plot to whatever data lives in the corresponding column in the data frame. Mapping was this process:\n\n\n\n\nThat’s not what we set out to do here. We just wanted to tweak the look of our aesthetic attributes in a way that doesn’t have anything to do with the data in our data frame. This process is called setting the attribute.\nTo set the color to blue3, we need to make just a small change to the syntax. Let’s move the color = \"blue\" argument outside of the aes() function and into the geom_() function.\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,\n                     y = bill_depth_mm)) +\n    geom_point(color = \"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAh, that looks much better!\nColor isn’t the only aesthetic attribute that you can set. Let’s increase slightly the size of our points by setting the size to three times the size of the default.\n\nCodeggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,\n                     y = bill_depth_mm)) +\n    geom_point(color = \"blue\", size = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s not clear that that improves the readability of the plot - there is more overlap between the points now - but the setting worked. How would it have looked if instead we had mapped the size? When you map, you need a map to a column in your data frame, so let’s map size to species.\n\nCodeggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,\n                     y = bill_depth_mm,\n                     size = species)) +\n    geom_point(color = \"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve made a mess of our plot now, but it is clear what happened. R looked inside the species column, found a categorical variable with three levels and selected a distinct size for each of those levels.\nThis is another area in which the grammar of graphic guides clear thinking when constructing a graphic. The aesthetic attributes of a plot can be determined either by variability found in a data set or by fixed values that we set. The former is present in all data visualization but it’s the latter that comes into play when fine-tuning your plot for an audience."

    "text": "2. Adding Labels for Clarity\nYou may have noticed that ggplot2 pulls the labels for the x-axis, the y-axis, and the legend directly from the names of the variables in the data frame. This results in labels like bill_length_mm, which is no problem when you’re making plots for yourself - you know what this variable means. But will an outside audience?\nYou can change the labels of your plot by adding a labs() layer.\n\nCodeggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,\n                     y = bill_depth_mm)) +\n    geom_point(color = \"blue\") +\n    labs(x = \"Bill Length (mm)\",\n         y = \"Bill Depth (mm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAxis and legend labels should be concise and often include the units of measurement. If you find them getting too wordy, know that you can clarify or expand on what is being plotted either in a figure caption or in the accompanying text.\nSpeaking of captions, those a can be added too, as well as a title.\n\nCodeggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,\n                     y = bill_depth_mm)) +\n    geom_point(color = \"blue\") +\n    labs(x = \"Bill Length (mm)\",\n         y = \"Bill Depth (mm)\",\n         title = \"Penguins show little association between bill length\\n and bill depth\",\n         caption = \"Source: Data collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman at Palmer Station, Antarctica\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe title of a plot is valuable real estate for communicating the primary story of your plot. It should highlight the most important structure in the data. In the plot above, there appears to be little correspondence between bill length and bill depth. Of course, that changes when we map species to color. Let’s make that plot and title it accordingly.\n\nCodeggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,\n                     y = bill_depth_mm,\n                     color = species)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    labs(x = \"Bill Length (mm)\",\n         y = \"Bill Depth (mm)\",\n         title = \"Bill length and bill depth positively correlated and\\n strongly dependent on species\",\n         caption = \"Source: Data collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman at Palmer Station, Antarctica\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe practice of using the plot title to convey the main message of the plot is used to powerful effect by the visualization experts at the British publication, The Financial Times4. They have developed a wealth of visualizations to help readers understand what is happening with public health throughout the pandemic. The sobering graphic below uses the title to guide the viewer to the most important visual structure in the plot: the yawning vertical gap between dosage rates between high and low income countries."

When using a line plot, that is usually the general trend seen when reading left to right.\nWhat is the first word that comes to mind to describe the trend in each of the four plots below?\n\nCodearbuthnot &lt;- mutate(arbuthnot, p_girls = girls / total)\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(arbuthnot, aes(x = year,\n                            y = p_girls)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    xlim(1629, 1635) +\n    labs(x = \"\", y = \"\")\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(arbuthnot, aes(x = year,\n                            y = p_girls)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    xlim(1703, 1707) +\n    labs(x = \"\", y = \"\")\n\np3 &lt;- ggplot(arbuthnot, aes(x = year,\n                            y = p_girls)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    labs(x = \"\", y = \"\")\n\np4 &lt;- ggplot(arbuthnot, aes(x = year,\n                            y = p_girls)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    ylim(0, 1) +\n    labs(x = \"\", y = \"\")\n\n(p1 + p2) / (p3 + p4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClockwise from the upper left, you likely said something like “increasing”, “decreasing”, “variable”, and “stable”. Now take a second look. What exactly is being plotted here?\nThe labels along the axes are a hint to what you’re looking at here. These are, in fact, four plots from the exact same data: Arbuthnot christening records, with the proportion of girls christened on the x-axis. What differs is the limits of the x- and y-axes.\nMost software will automatically set the limits of your plot based on the range of the data. In the Arbuthnot data, the years range from 1629 to 1710 and the proportion of girls christened ranges from .463 to .497. The leads to the default graphic found in the lower left panel. Each of the other three plots have modified the limits of the x- or y-axis to capture different parts the data scaled in different ways. In ggplot2 this is done by adding an xlim() or ylim() layer.\nThis is the power of scaling. From one data set, you can convey four different (and incompatible!) messages by changing the scale. So which one is correct? It depends on the context and the question that drove the collection of the data. John Arbuthnot sought to understand the whether the chance of being born a girl is 1/2. That question is answered most clearly by the following plot (with the title driving home that main message).\n\nCodeggplot(arbuthnot, aes(x = year,\n                      y = p_girls)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    ylim(0, 1) +\n    labs(title = \"Proportion girls christened slightly but persistently\\n below 50%\",\n         x = \"Year\",\n         y = \"Proportion\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe importance of scale extends beyond scatter and line plots. Barcharts are often the subject of careful scaling to convey a particular message. What do you think the goal was of the creator of the plot titled “Should Britain Leave EU?”5"

    "section": "4. Overplotting",
    "text": "4. Overplotting\nIntroductory statistics students filled out a survey that asked them their opinion on several topics including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result was a data frame with 707 rows (one for every respondent) and 2 columns of discrete numerical data. A natural way to visualize this data is by creating a scatter plot.\n\nCodeggplot(class_survey, aes(x = tech,\n                         y = crypto)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    labs(x = \"Technology is destructive to relationships\",\n         y = \"cryptocurrency will play a\\n dominant role in finance\",\n         title = \"No association between opinions on technology and \\n cryptocurrency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe eye is immediately drawn to the eerie geometric regularity of this data. Isn’t real data messier than this? What’s going on?\nA hint is in the sample size. The number of observations in the data set was over 600 and yet the number of points shown here is just a bit under 100. Where did those other observations go?\nIt turns out they are in this plot, they’re just piled on on top of the other. Since there are only 10 possible values for each question, many students ended up selecting the same values for both, leading their points to be drawn on top of one another.\nThis phenomenon is called overplotting and it is very common in large data sets. There are several strategies for dealing with it, but here we cover two of them.\nOne approach to fixing the problem of points piled on top of one another is to unpile them by adding just a little bit of random noise to their x- and y-coordinate. This technique is called jittering and can be done in ggplot2 by replacing geom_point() with geom_jitter().\n\nCodeset.seed(20)\nggplot(class_survey, aes(x = tech,\n                         y = crypto)) +\n    geom_jitter() +\n    labs(x = \"Technology is destructive to relationships\",\n         y = \"cryptocurrency will play a\\n dominant role in finance\",\n         title = \"No association between opinions on technology and \\n cryptocurrency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAhh . . . there are those previously hidden students. Interestingly, the title on the first plot still holds true: even when we’re looking at all of the students, there doesn’t appear to be much of a pattern. There is certainly not the case in all overplotted data sets! Often overplotting will obscure a pattern that jumps out after the overplotting has been attended to.\nThe second technique is to make the points transparent by changing an aestheric attribute called the alpha value. Let’s combine tranparency with jittering to understand the effect.\n\nCodeset.seed(20)\nggplot(class_survey, aes(x = tech,\n                         y = crypto)) +\n    geom_jitter(alpha = .3) +\n    labs(x = \"Technology is destructive to relationships\",\n         y = \"cryptocurrency will play a\\n dominant role in finance\",\n         title = \"No association between opinions on technology and \\n cryptocurrency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlpha is a number between 0 and 1, where 1 is fully opaque and 0 is fully see-through. Here, alpha = .3, which changes all observations from black to gray. Where the points overlap, their alpha values add to create a dark blob.\nThere’s still no sign of a strong association between these variables, but at least, by taking overplotting into consideration, we’ve made that determination after incorporating all of the data."

Small decisions like these that effect the overall look and feel of the plot are called the theme.\nLet’s look at a few more.

The ggplot2 library has several themes to choose from and yet more live in other packages like ggthemes. To use a theme, all you need to do is add a layer called theme_NAME (e.g. for the black and white theme, use theme_bw).\nThemeing your plots is an easy way to change the look of your plot. Tinker with a few different themes and considering adding them to your labs6. But, as with all design decisions around graphics, be sure to think about your audience. You might find the Excel aesthetics ugly and dated, but will your audience? If you’re presenting your plot to a community that works with Excel plots day in and day out, that’s probably a sound choice. If you are preparing a plot for submission to a scientific journal, a more minimalist theme is more appropriate."

Annotations\nIn the same way that a title highlights the main message of a plot, you can rely upon visual cues to draw attention to certain components or provide helpful context.\nThe christening records collected by John Arbuthnot, although they seem like a very simple data set, actually capture a wealth of historical information.

This very important context can be conveyed by adding a text label and a line segment through two new annotate() layers.\nWithin ggplot2, annotations are a flexible way to add the context or comparisons that help guide readers in interpreting your data. You can add text, shapes, lines, points. To learn more, consult the documentation7.\nSo if the drop after 1642 corresponds to the English Civil War, what about the spike down around 1666? What about 1703? If you’re curious, explore Wikipedia to find out and add those events as annotations to this plot."

Most people would reason from direct experience, anecdote, appeals to tradition or religion, etc.\nIf you were Dr. Arbuthnot and you tell the person on the street: “My wife will soon be giving birth. What are the chances it’s a girl?”, what sort of answer do you think he might get? What type of information might that person be relying upon? - their own experience (the ratio of girls born in their family) - anecdotes that they’ve heard from others\nYou may want to note that even our notion of “chance” and probability was not wide spread at the time.\nArbuthnot’s work is notable because he takes the big step of realizing that an individual can learn a lot by pooling the experiences / anecdotes of others in a systematic way."

    "text": "Course Culture\nStudents taking Stat 20 come from a wide range of backgrounds. We hope to foster an inclusive and supportive learning environment based on curiosity rather than competition. All members of the course community—the instructor, students, tutors, and readers—are expected to treat each other with courtesy and respect.\nYou will be interacting with course staff and fellow students in several different environments: in class, over the discussion forum, and in office hours. Some of these will be in person, some of them will be online, but the same expectations hold: be kind, be respectful, be professional.\nIf you are concerned about classroom environment issues created by other students or course staff, please come talk to us about it.\n\n\nMode of Instruction\nThis course is structured as a flipped class, meaning that you will first be encountering new concepts in statistics and data science outside of class. Class time is dedicated to expanding on the work you’ve done outside of class by working through questions solo, in groups, and as a class.\n\nBefore class\nIt is your responsibility to become familiar with the topics that appear in the course notes and to work through the reading questions on Gradescope by 11:59 pm on the day before class.\n\n\nDuring class on Tue/Wed and Thu/Fri\nClass time (2 hrs) will be spent on a range of activities, but the most common will be concept questions (using Poll Everywhere) and working through components of your Problem Sets and Labs. Therefore, the most efficient way to complete your assignments is to be an active participant in class. Attendance is expected on these class days.\n\n\nDuring class on Monday\nMonday is shorter (1 hr) class that alternates between:\n\nWorkshops: less-structured class dedicated to finishing up work on your assignments\nQuizzes: see information on quizzes below.\n\n\n\n\nGroup tutoring\nTutors will offer group tutoring sessions several times each week. This is an opportunity to finish up any assignments that you’ve started in class or review any topics that are confusing for you. Each group tutoring session will be staffed by 2-4 tutors. You’re welcome to attend any session that works well for your schedule. Check the Office Hours page to see the group tutoring schedule.\nGroup tutoring is a great place to go to meet other students and collaborate on assignments with tutors on hand to help you get unstuck.\n\n\nInstructor Office Hours\nThe instructors will offer office hours each week across a range of times. We ask that you only visit the office hours of your instructor, but you are welcome to visit the tutoring sessions of any tutors, not just the ones who work in your section. We may adjust the office hour and group tutoring sessions schedule throughout the semester as we understand student needs and preferences. Please check the Office Hours page to see the times of the various office hour/group tutoring sessions.\nOffice hours are an opportunity to chat one-on-one with your instructor. Please come to office hours! Coming to office hours does not send a signal that you are behind or need extra help. On the contrary, coming to office hours early and often tends to co-occur with success in the course. Instructors are happy to chat about the course material, statistics in general, careers in statistics, and whatever other statistics or data science topics are on your mind!\n\n\nDon’t come to class if you’re sick!\nMaintaining your health and that of the Berkeley community is of primary importance to course staff, so if you are feeling ill or have been exposed to illness, whether it’s COVID-19 or something else, please do not come to class. All of the materials used in class will be posted to the course website. You’re encouraged to reach out to fellow students to discuss the class materials or stop by group tutoring or office hours to chat with a tutor or the instructor.\n\n\n\nMaterials\nThe primary materials for the course are the lecture notes, which will be posted to the course website in advance of class. We’ll teach you everything you need to know!\nThe following textbooks are useful supplementary texts but there is no need to purchase them:\n\nIntroduction to Modern Statistics by Çetinkaya-Rundel and Hardin (freely available online)\nStatistics, Freedman, Pisani, and Purves\nData Visualization: A Practical Introduction, Healy (freely available online)\nHands-on Programming with R, Grolemund (freely available online)\nR for Data Science, Wickham and Grolemund (freely available online)\n\n\nRStudio\nThe software that we’ll be using for our data analysis is the free and open-source language called R that we’ll be interacting with via software called RStudio. As a Berkeley student, you have your own version of RStudio waiting you for at: http://stat20.datahub.berkeley.edu. Most students taking Stat 20 have no experience programming; we’ll teach you everything you need to know!\n\n\n\nCourse communication\n\nbCourses\nWe don’t use bCourses for much. It is primarily used to disseminate announcements for the entire class, such as final exam information.\n\n\nDiscussion forum\nThe official discussion forum for the class will be hosted on Ed. Ed is a forum to ask and answer questions with your fellow students and course staff. It’s an indispensable resource for learning from your peers and seeking help from tutors and instructors.\nIf you have a question for staff, create a new post and mark it as “private” and it will go only to course staff. This is the best option to contact us if you have a personal concern. If your question does not include personal information and can be answered by other students, make sure it is public.\nIn a course this large, the instructors have a difficult time responding to individual emails, so please use the class forum or visit office hours if you wish to contact us!\n\n\nCourse website\nAll of the assignments will be posted here to the course website. This also holds the course notes, slides, and links to Gradescope, Ed, and RStudio.\n\n\n\nAssignments, Exams, and Grading\n\nTurning-in assignments\nYou will be turning in your assignments on a platform called Gradescope. This is also the platform where your assignments will be graded, so you can return there to get feedback on your work. You are welcome to file a regrade request if you notice that we made an error in applying the rubric to your work.\n\n\nLabs\nLabs are long-form assignments designed to apply the concepts from the lecture notes in the cause of doing an analysis of real data. This will involve both writing code and communicating your thoughts and findings in English. We’ll be working through some problems from the labs in class, but you may have to complete them on your own outside of class time. Some labs will be turned in individually; some will be turned in as groups.\nLabs are to be submitted as PDF files. These PDFs will be generated by rendering Quarto Documents (.qmd files) to HTML and then exporting the HTML into a PDF. Don’t worry if you’re not familiar with the Quarto Document as we will teach you about it!\nWe will be assessing most questions on labs for correctness but for others we will be giving credit based on completion.\n\n\nWorksheets\nDuring class, we will give you a second engagement with the day’s material in the form of a worksheet. These worksheets will run like traditional homework problems and drill the concepts in the reading notes rather than asking you to apply the concepts with a data set, like the lab does. These are graded credit / no credit, where full credit is given if you earnestly engage with the assignments.\n\n\nReading Questions\nReading questions serve to check your understanding and engagement while going through the lecture notes prior to class. There will be a handful of questions per lecture note. These questions be a mix of multiple choice, short answer, and coding questions. You can answer them directly on Gradescope. The reading questions will be due 11:59 pm on the day before class.\n\n\n\nQuizzes\nQuizzes reinforce the most important concepts from the lecture notes and provide you the opportunity to work through misunderstandings of concepts with peers and the instructor.\nThere is both an individual and group component to the quiz.\nThe individual component will last ~25 minutes. You are allowed one, A4, one-sided handwritten sheet of notes with your name in the upper right-hand corner. The group component will take place immediately after the individual component has been completed and will last ~15 minutes. Your final (composite) quiz grade will be the average of your group and individual quiz scores.\n\n\nExam\nThe final exam will be held in person during finals week. The time and date is Wednesday December 18th, 7 - 10 pm.\n\n\nGrading\nYour final grade in the course will be computed as follows:\n\nLabs 35%\nReading Questions: 3%\nQuizzes 25%\nProblem sets 7%\nFinal 30%\n\nThe grades will not be curved (&gt; 90% is some kind of A, etc.).\nIn order to provide flexibility around emergencies that might arise for you throughout the semester we will drop everyone’s lowest quiz grade before calculating your quiz average at the end of the semester. We will also drop your two lowest Reading Question scores; there are so many of those that it is understandable if you miss one or two.\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nAccomodations for students with disabilities\nStat 20 is a course that is designed to allow all students to succeed. If you have letters of accommodations from the Disabled Students’ Program, please share them with your instructor as soon as possible, and we will work out the necessary arrangements.\n\n\nLate Work\nIf you don’t get your work in by the deadline, don’t fret. Fill out the extension request form to request an extension of 1-3 days. We will be approving all requests for extensions that are three days or fewer past the assignment deadline. For longer extensions, such as serious illness, speak to your instructor.\n\n\n\nCollaboration policy\nYou are encouraged to collaborate with your fellow students on problem sets and labs, but the work you turn in should reflect your own understanding and all of your collaborators must be cited. The individual component of quizzes, reading questions, and exams must reflect only your work.\nResearchers don’t use one another’s research without permission; scholars and students always use proper citations in papers; professors may not circulate or publish student papers without the writer’s permission; and students may not circulate or post non-public materials (quizzes, exams, rubrics-any private class materials) from their class without the written permission of the instructor.\nThe general rule: you must not submit assignments that reflect the work of others unless they are a cited collaborator.\nThe following examples of collaboration are allowed and in fact encouraged!\n\nDiscussing how to solve a problem with a classmate.\nShowing your code to a classmate along with an error message or confusing output.\nPosting snippets of your code to the discussion forum when seeking help.\nHelping other students solve questions on the discussion with conceptual pointers or snippets of code that doesn’t whole hog give away the answer.\nGoogling the text of an error message.\nCopying small snippets of code from answers on Stack Overflow.\n\nThe following examples are not allowed:\n\nLeaving a representation of your assignment (the text, a screenshot) where students (current and future) can access it. Examples of this include websites like course hero, on a group text chain, over discord/slack, or in a file passed on to future students.\nAccessing and submitting solutions to assignments from other students distributed as above. This includes copying written answers from other students and slightly modifying the language to differentiate it.\nGoogling for complete problem solutions.\nWorking on the reading questions or individual quizzes in collaboration with other people or resources. These assignments must reflect individual work.\nSubmitting work on an quiz or final that reflects consultation with outside resources or other people. These assessments must reflect individual work.\n\nIf you have questions about the boundaries of the policy, please ask. We’re always happy to clarify.\n\nViolations of the collaboration policy\nThe integrity of our course depends on our ability to ensure that students do not violate the collaboration policy. We take this responsibility seriously and forward cases of academic misconduct to the Center for Student Conduct.\nStudents determined to have violated the academic misconduct policy by the Center for Student Conduct will receive a grade penalty in the course and a sanction from the university which is generally: (i) First violation: Non-Reportable Warning and educational intervention, (ii) Second violation: Suspension/Disciplinary Probation and educational interventions, (iii) Third violation: Dismissal.\nAnd again, if you have questions about the boundaries of the collaboration policy, please ask!\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat should I do if I’m on the waitlist?\nAttend both lecture and section (remember, we are teaching it as one two hour class), and submit all assignments on time. Visit your instructor on the first day of class so you can be added to the course Ed and Gradescope.\nAre class sessions recorded?\nNo. Class sessions feature a mix of group problem solving, activities, and discussion and don’t lend themselves to recording. The course notes are the main reference source for the course. Any materials used during the class session will be posted to the course website.\nIs attendance required?\nNo, but it is difficult to succeed in this course if you are not regularly attending class. Class sessions are designed to be an effective and efficient format to make progress on important assignments. Plus, it’s a great way to meet your fellow students and learn from one another. This class is very unique in that regard.\nIf you can’t attend due to a religious observance, athletic competition, or something similarly important, don’t worry. Just reach out to us via a private Ed post, and we can let you know what to keep tabs on during the time you’re away.\nAre time conflicts allowed?\n\nStat 20 does not allow students to enroll with time conflicts.\n\nWhat if I join the class late?\nIf you join the class within the first two weeks, read the syllabus and lecture notes, take a look at Gradescope to get a sense of any assignments that may have already passed, and visit office hours to check that you’re up to date with things. The first two weeks of material are very important so you must be able to make up assignments.\nAfter two weeks into the semester, you’ll have too much material that you’ll need to make up, so you will have to wait to a subsequent semester to take Stat 20.\n\n\n\nCampus Resources\nIf you ever need someone to talk to about anything that you’re going through, please feel to reach out to the instructors. For some topics, the tutors might be an even better resource because they are students just like you. Tutors can also tell you what being an Academic Student Employee (ASE) is like.\nWith regards to reports of sexual misconduct/violence/assault, you may speak with us as well, but know that we will need to report our discussion to the Title IX officer. This is detailed below.\n\nAs UC employees, the instructors (and tutors) are “Responsible Employees” and are therefore required to report incidents of sexual violence, sexual harassment, or other conduct prohibited by University policy to the Title IX officer. We cannot keep reports of sexual harassment or sexual violence confidential, but the Title IX officer will consider requests for confidentiality. Note that there are confidential resources available to you through UCB’s PATH to Care Center, which serves survivors of sexual violence and sexual harassment; call their 24/7 Care Line at 510-643-2005.\n\nBelow are some campus resources that may be helpful for you:\n\nBerkeley Supportal- great place to start\nDisabled Students’ Program\nUniversity Health Services\nUCB Path to Care\nStudent Learning Center\nBerkeley International Office\nOmbuds Office for Students and Postdoctoral Appointees\nGender Equity Resource Center\nCenter for Educational Justice & Community Engagement\nUHS Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)\nCampus Academic Accommodations Hub\nASUC Student Advocate’s Office\nBasic Needs Center\nASUC Mental Health Resources Guide"

In general, in Part I you will identify the question of interest, consider the manner in which it arose, and set expectations for the shape and structure of the data.\nPart II is where you get your hands on the data and consider where it aligns with and diverges from your expections from Part I. Part III features extensions of the ideas in Part I and Part II, often to a new data set.\nYour work should feature writing that is clear and in full sentences. Your document should be formatted cleanly, with appropriate use of headers, body text, and lists. Your code should be clear and simple, with no extraneous code.\nCertain questions on the labs in this class call for speculation or for your opinion.
